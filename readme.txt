**Real Testimonials**

> "Must-have for content marketing. This is a super easy way to customize the featured images that appear in the RSS feed – no more ugly pre-populated visuals. I especially love the Mailchimp integration. It’s great to have this much control over our content. Image is everything!" - @morganmariequinn [Read the review](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/must-have-for-content-marketing/)

> "Must Have for Featured Image Based Themes & MailChimp Users. For several years my WordPress theme has used featured images at the head of all my posts. The problem is, then, when feeding my RSS feed to MailChimp, that featured image at the head of the post is lost. Sometimes the image is highly crucial to the post (not to mention more enjoyable), so this plugin is a life saver. A must have!" - @ericdye [Read the review](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/must-have-for-featured-image-based-themes-mailchimp-users/)

> "It just works – lovely! Great with MailChimp. I installed this plugin, changed the (very simple) settings and the featured images started appearing in my MailChimp campaigns straight away – perfect!" - @barn2media [Read the review](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/it-just-works-lovely-great-with-mailchimp/)
